# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This study guide can be used as a tool for any new developer joing the Rutgers bootcamp! It involves a plethora of information on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript basics. The goal behind this application was to be able to house all the important information learned throughout the prework and to be able to refer back to or even help someone new joining the developer community. This allows you to keep your notes organized as you go through learning these intense yet exciting topics!

 This study guide allows you to review the notes quickly and keeps them in one disignated spot so it is easier to refer back when needed. It even will suggest which topic to study first! To do so, open Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There will house all the topics studied and the suggestion for you!
