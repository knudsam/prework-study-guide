        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>There are 3 ways to style a webpage using CSS -- Inline, Internal, and External.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS: is when a developer wants to style an element in HTML (it is a quick and permanent way to style).</li>
          <li>Internal CSS: in HTML you can add "style" into the head element to make some design changes that apply to that one page.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheets: this allows a developer to create all CSS changes in a separate file where changes can be made easier and then added to HTML after. (most common)</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>pwd: dispays the current working directory.</li>
          <li>ls: lists files and folders in the current directory.</li>
          <li>cd: navigates between directories in the path white cd .. will navigate you backwards one step at a time.</li>
          <li>mkdir: creates a new directory.</li>
          <li>touch: creates a file inside a directory.</li>
          <li>git command must ALWAYS start a statement.</li>

        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A variable must always have a name and anything in your string must be in "".</li>
          <li>When creating functions in JavaScript you must follow this path: 1. Add a variable 2. Add conditional logis 3. Incorporate arrays and for loops. 4. Complete the git flow.</li>
          <li>console.log is used to output a message to the web by adding an arguement.</li>
          <li>Strict equality operator (===) - this checks to see if two values are equal.</li>
          <li>Array: stores a group of related data using [].</li>
          <li>for loop: uses the predictible pattern of indicies to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single block to be executed over and over.</li>
          <li>First item of an array is ALWAYS 0</li>
          <li>for loops contain three important statements -- 1. determine the starting point for our loop 2. the condition 3. what allow the array to iterate over and over.</li>
          <li>x++ is a shortcut way of say x+1.</li>
          <li>Commenting out code is when you add /* before and */ after.</li>
